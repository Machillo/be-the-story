# Be the story 🎮

A narrative decision-based web game where every choice shapes your stats and your story.

## 🧠 Concept

You begin at a symbolic crossroads in life. As you make choices, your path branches into one of three directions:

- **Self-Improvement** 💪
- **Conformism** 😐
- **Inaction** 🛑

Each scene challenges your values, mindset, relationships, and resilience. Your decisions directly affect your character's stats:

- Motivation
- Morality
- Intelligence
- Health
- Energy

The final outcome of your story is based on how your stats evolve.
